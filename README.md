*

### Wireframes

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs
------
This project will be implemented using the following technologies: 
* Canvas API to render the game grid as well as the units and animations.
* Webpack and npm to bundle the Javascript Code and manage project dependencies.
* Babel to transpile the Javascript Code.

### Implementation Timeline (Need to expand/add more details)
------
* **Friday Afternoon**: Setup project/Webpack/Start getting comfortable with Canvas and how I will render units on the screen.

* **Saturday**: Get the board to appear on Canvas as well as “basic units”. 
Create the Unit class. (Though the units will probably take a longer time to properly format on the screen and will be something I will continue to tweak through the coming days).

* **Sunday**: Finish up the board rendering, as well as make sure cover is included. 
Build the logical foundations of the game, i.e., how it receives and interprets user input.

* **Monday**: Finishing building up the logic foundations of the game and allow for the user’s input to show up on the canvas screen.

* **Tuesday**: Finish up rendering user input and build (basic) enemy AI - Game should be functional at this point. 

* **Wednesday**: Add a victory/defeat screen. Work on stylizing the project through css. 
If I have time work on bonus features. such as increasing the AI logic or adding combat music.

* **Thursday Morning**: Finish up production, write a Production Readme, and deploy through GitHub.
