# MINI_XCOM

### Background
-------
In MINI_XCOM, the player commands a squad of hardened space marines. In turn-based combat on a grid-based board, 
the player battles the AI in last man standing fight.  If all of player’s units die, they lose. If they defeat all the enemies, they win. Each turn, and for each
unit, the player can either:
  1) Move the Unit 
  2) Command it to shoot an enemy
 
After the player's turn, the AI will make a turn and command its units in a similar way to either move or shoot. Each unit, both friend and foe, has a set of stats. These stats include a movement range, shotting range, and health points. The player can also, at anytime, view their units' stats. The player must also be stragetic about their movement choices as cover morphs the battlefiled into choke points and kill zones.

The player must become the commander these marines need to survie. FOR THE EMPEROR!


### Functionality & MVPs
-------
With MINI_XCOM, users will be able to:
* To fight in turn-based, combat against a competent AI. 
* View the stats of their units so as best utilize their forces.
* 
Furthermore, this project will include: 
* An intro section describing the background and rules of MINI_XCOM.
* A production README

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs
------
This project will be implemented using the following technologies: 
* Canvas API to render the game grid as well as the units and animations.
* Webpack and npm to bundle the Javascript Code and manage project dependencies.
* Babel to transpile the Javascript Code.

### Implementation Timeline (Need to expand/add more details)
------
* **Friday Afternoon**: Setup project/Webpack/Start getting comfortable with Canvas and how I will render units on the screen.

* **Saturday**: Get the board to appear on Canvas as well as “basic units”. 
Create the Unit class. (Though the units will probably take a longer time to properly format on the screen and will be something I will continue to tweak through the coming days).

* **Sunday**: Finish up the board rendering, as well as make sure cover is included. 
Build the logical foundations of the game, i.e., how it receives and interprets user input.

* **Monday**: Finishing building up the logic foundations of the game and allow for the user’s input to show up on the canvas screen.

* **Tuesday**: Finish up rendering user input and build (basic) enemy AI - Game should be functional at this point. 

* **Wednesday**: Add a victory/defeat screen. Work on stylizing the project through css. 
If I have time work on bonus features. such as increasing the AI logic or adding combat music.

* **Thursday Morning**: Finish up production, write a Production Readme, and deploy through GitHub.
